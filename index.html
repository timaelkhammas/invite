            Memory (the deliberate act of remembering) is a form of willed creation. It is not an effort to find out the way it really was â€” that is research. 
            The point is to dwell on the way it appeared and why it appeared in that particular way.
            <br><br>
            I once knew a woman named Hannah Peace. I say knew, but nothing could be less accurate. I was perhaps four years old when she was in the town 
            where I lived. I don't know where or even if she is now, or to whom she was related then. She was not even a visiting friend. 
            I couldn't describe her in a way that would make her known in a photograph, nor would I recognize her if she walked into this room. 
            But I have a memory of her, and it's like this: the color of her skin - the mat quality of it.
            Something purple around her. Also eyes not completely open. There emanated from her an aloofness that seemed to me kindly disposed. 
            But most of all I remember her name - or the way people pronounced it. Never Hannah or Miss Peace. Always Hannah Peace. 
            And more: something hidden - some awe perhaps, but certainly some forgiveness. When they pronounced her name they (the women and the men) 
            forgave her something.
            <br><br>
            The pieces (and only the pieces) are what begin the creative process for me.
            And the process by which the recollections of these pieces coalesce into a part
            (and knowing the difference between a piece and a part) is creation. Memory,
            then, no matter how small the piece remembered, demands my respect, my
            attention, and my trust.
            <br><br>
            I depend heavily on the ruse of memory (and in a way it does function as a creative writer's ruse) for two reasons. 
            One, because it ignites some process of invention, and two, because I cannot trust the literature and the sociology of
            other people to help me know the truth ofmy own cultural sources. It also
            prevents my preoccupations from descending into sociology.
            <br><br>
            There may be play and arbitrariness in the way memory surfaces, but none in the way the composition is organized, 
            especially when I hope to recreate play and arbitrariness in the way narrative events unfold. The form becomes
            the exact interpretation of the idea the story is meant to express. There is nothing more traditional than that - 
            but the sources of the images are not the traditional novelistic or readerly ones.
            <br><br>
            My compact with the reader is not to reveal an already established reality
            (literary or historical) that he or she and I agree upon beforehand. I don't
            want to assume or exercise that kind ofauthority. I regard that as patronizing,
            although many people regard it as safe and reassuring. And because my
            metier is Black, the artistic demands of Black culture are such that I cannot
            patronize, control, or pontificate. In the Third World cosmology as I perceive
            it, reality is not already constituted by my literary predecessors in
            Western culture. If my work is to confront a reality unlike that received
            reality of the West, it must centralize and animate information discredited
            by the West- discredited not because it is not true or useful or even of some
            racial value, but because it is information held by discredited people, information
            dismissed as "lore" or "gossip" or "magic" or "sentiment."
